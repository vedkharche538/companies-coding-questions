"""
Using the Python language, have the function BipartiteMatching(strArr)
read strArr which will be an array of hyphenated letters representing
paths from the first node to the second node.
For example: ["a->d", "a->e", "b->f", "c->e"] means that
there is a path from node a to d, a to e, b to f, and so on.
The graph will be bipartite meaning that it is possible to separate
the nodes into two disjoint sets such that every edge only connects
a node from the lefthand side to a node on the righthand side.
Your program should determine the maximum cardinality matching
of the bipartite graph, which means finding the largest possible number
of non-adjacent edges that are matching. So for the example above,
your program should return 3 because it is possible to connect
every single node on the left to a node on the right. 
The input will only contain lowercase alphabetic characters with
a -> between them signifying an edge between them going from
the left node to the right node.
The input will contain at least 1 edge connecting 2 nodes. 
Input:"a->w", "a->x", "b->x", "b->y", "c->x", "c->z", "d->w"
Output:4
Input:"a->b", "c->b", "c->d", "e->b"
Output:2
